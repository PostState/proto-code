# proto-code

This code is an initial implementation that takes into account the economic functionality of the blockchain. You can continue development by adding handlers for other types of transactions and functionality described in your text.

Please note that this is just an example and does not include all aspects of blockchain development on the Cosmos SDK. You will need to take a closer look at the Cosmos SDK and tailor the code to your specific concept and requirements.
